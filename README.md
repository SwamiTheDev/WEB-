# website
   A basic sample website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap might include the following elements:
     1. HTML: The structure of the website, including elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
     2. CSS: The styling of the website, including colors, fonts, and layout.
     3.  Bootstrap: A framework that provides pre-built CSS and JavaScript components, such as navigation bars, buttons, and forms.
# HTML
  1. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It is used to create the structure and layout of a webpage, and to define the different elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags and attributes to define the structure and layout of a webpage. It can be written using any text editor and viewed in a web browser.
# css
  1. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. It is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of web pages. With CSS, developers can separate the presentation of a website from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update.
  2. CSS allows you to change the visual presentation of HTML elements by applying styles to specific tags, classes, or ids. It also allows the creation of reusable style rules, cascading effect, and media-queries that allows to apply different styles based on certain conditions like screen size or device.
CSS can be written in separate .css files or embedded in the HTML document. It's widely supported by all web browsers.
# bootstrap5
   Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end development framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. It is built with HTML, CSS,       and JavaScript, and uses a grid-based layout system to make it easy to create responsive, mobile-friendly designs.
    Bootstrap 5 is the latest version of Bootstrap. It comes with new features such as:

      1. Dropped support for Internet Explorer 10 and 11.
      2. Removed jQuery as a dependency, opting for vanilla JavaScript.
      3. Improved Grid system and Layout
      4. New form controls and custom form styles.
      5. Improved spacing and sizing utilities.
      6. Improved documentation and examples.
         And more..
   Bootstrap 5 also includes some changes to classes and class names to improve consistency and readability, so developers familiar with previous versions of Bootstrap        may need to update their code when migrating to Bootstrap 5
